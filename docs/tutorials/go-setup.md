# Setting up a dev container for Go

## Introduction

Welcome! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a containerized environment from which you can code up and run your first program in Go. Yippee!

!!! note "Side Note"

    Go is a **Functional Language**. The programming languages that you already familiar with are likely *Object Oriented Languages*. These include ```python```, ```c/c++```, ```java```, and many other languages. The key difference between Functional Languages and Object Oriented Languages is that all the data in a Function Language is ***immutable***. An immutable value is a primitive value that cannot change. Freaky, right?

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, make sure to:

 - **Have git installed**. You can install it [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
 - Download and install **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code) from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
 - **Install Docker:** get it [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

With that out of the way, we can get into the good stuff.

## Project Setup: Create a git repository
