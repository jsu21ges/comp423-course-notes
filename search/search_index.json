In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a containerized environment from which you can code up and run your first program in Go. Yippee!</p> <p>Side Note</p> <p>Go is a Functional Language. The programming languages that you already familiar with are likely Object Oriented Languages. These include <code>python</code>, <code>c/c++</code>, <code>java</code>, and many other languages. The key difference between Functional Languages and Object Oriented Languages is that all the data in a Function Language is immutable. An immutable value is a primitive value that cannot change.

It's all for the sake of convenience: <code>go run hello.go</code> takes <code>go build hello.go</code> and <code>./hello</code> and combines them into a single command.
